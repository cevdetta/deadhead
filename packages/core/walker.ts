 * still visited; only its descendants are skipped.
 *
 * The second group is parsed as text by the HTML Standard (raw text or RCDATA,
 * and `noscript` with scripting enabled), so a spec parser never builds
 * elements inside them. parse5 follows the spec; linkedom and
 * `@html-eslint/parser` do not, and without this they report findings inside
 * that parse5 cannot see.
 *
 * `plaintext` has no end tag: a spec parser turns everything after it into
 * text. linkedom and `@html-eslint/parser` leave it open instead, so what
 * follows becomes its descendants, and skipping them makes all three agree.
 * Only an explicit `</plaintext>`, which a browser ignores, still splits them.
