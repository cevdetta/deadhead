 * Two deliberate choices:
 *
 * - The *end* offset is compared, not the start. The spec requires the element
 *   to be "serialized completely within the first 1024 bytes", so a declaration
 *   straddling the boundary is already lost.
 * - Offsets are in characters, not bytes. The port has no access to the source
 *   text, so the true byte count cannot be computed here — but every non-ASCII
 *   character before the declaration only makes that count larger, so this
 *   under-reports and never fabricates a finding.
