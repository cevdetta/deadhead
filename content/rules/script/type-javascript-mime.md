`type="text/javascript"` dates from a time when the script language was genuinely in
question: Netscape shipped JavaScript, Internet Explorer shipped JScript and VBScript,
and HTML 4.01 made `type` a required attribute with no default. That stopped being true
in HTML5, which defines the classic-script path as what happens when `type` is absent.

## Why avoid

The attribute is not merely redundant, it is the *only* spelling the spec advises
against. A `<script>` whose `type` is a JavaScript MIME type is processed exactly as one
with no `type` at all, and the HTML Standard says authors should omit it. The value is
also a legacy compatibility surface: `text/javascript1.3`, `text/jscript` and
`text/livescript` are still accepted for content that has not been touched since the
1990s, which means a typo like `text/javasript` does not error — it silently makes the
element a data block that never executes.

Carrying it forward teaches the wrong model of the attribute. `type` is now meaningful
and load-bearing: `module`, `importmap` and `speculationrules` change what the element
*is*. Treating it as boilerplate is how `type="module"` ends up deleted by a well-meaning
cleanup.

## Use instead

Omit it for classic scripts:

```html
<script src="/app.js"></script>
<script>console.log("classic script");</script>
```

Keep it wherever it selects behaviour:

```html
<script type="module" src="/app.js"></script>
<script type="importmap">{ "imports": { "lit": "/vendor/lit.js" } }</script>
<script type="application/json" id="state">{ "user": null }</script>
```

## Detectability

Fully detectable, but not by the selector alone. `script[type]` is only a pre-filter: the
verdict depends on whether the trimmed value is a *JavaScript MIME type essence match*,
a sixteen-entry list the selector subset cannot enumerate. The decision therefore lives in
`packages/rules/logic/script/type-javascript-mime.ts`.

Anything the logic does not recognise is left alone, and one exclusion is load-bearing:
a type with parameters, such as `text/javascript; charset=utf-8`, is *not* an essence
match, so the browser treats that element as a data block and never runs it. Removing the
attribute would start executing code that has never executed. The same goes for a typo
like `text/javasript`. Both are real bugs; neither is safe to autofix, so this rule does
not claim them.
