The HTML parser does not know a JSON-LD block holds JSON. It reads the element's text as
script data up to the first `</script`, string or no string. `JSON.stringify` leaves `<`
literal, so a value that carries `</script>` ends the block and turns the rest of the
value into markup.

## Why avoid

The break-out is a stored-XSS path with a shipped exploit. GitHub advisory
GHSA-2ggx-79g6-2jmj (Hi.Events, CVE-2026-60119, rated high) records it in a JSON-LD
block: the event page rendered
`<script type="application/ld+json">{JSON.stringify(schemaOrgJSONLD)}</script>`, and
"JSON.stringify() does not escape the sequence </script>". An organizer's event title
closed the block and ran script in the browser of every visitor, administrators included.
The Next.js JSON-LD guide carries the same warning: `JSON.stringify` "does not sanitize
malicious strings used in XSS injection".

The reverse sequence breaks the page. The HTML Standard requires every `script` element's
text to match its `script` grammar, which forbids an unclosed `<!--` and a `<script`
inside one. §4.12.1.3 shows why: after `<!--` and `<script`, the parser no longer ends the
element at `</script>`, and the markup after the block becomes script text that never
renders.

Search engines lose the data in both cases. A truncated or overrun block fails
`JSON.parse`, and a JSON-LD processor discards the whole block on the first syntax error.

## Use instead

Escape `<` when serializing, as the Next.js guide does:

```js
const json = JSON.stringify(data).replace(/</g, "\\u003c");
```

The output carries no literal `<`, and consumers read the same value:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"\u003c/script> Night"}</script>
```

Fix the serializer and not the page. An edited page stays safe until the next render
writes the old output back.

## Detectability

Partial. The rule reports a JSON-LD block whose text holds a literal `<`, and each
finding carries `possible: true`. A literal `<` proves the serializer passes `<` through;
it does not prove an attack, and a hand-written `"description": "5 < 6"` reports the
same way. A block with no `<` today proves nothing: the same serializer emits `</script>`
the day a value carries it. The CLI, the bookmarklet and the ESLint plugin all report;
none skips, since the check reads the element's text and no source offset.

The threshold is wider than the spec. The `script` grammar forbids `<!--` and `<script`
in specific arrangements, and the rule flags any `<`: the dangerous sequences all start
with one, and a serializer that passes one `<` passes all of them. `>` and `&` are inert
in script data, so the rule ignores them.

A `</script>` already in a value ends the element at parse time, so the rule sees the
truncated block. That page trips `script/json-ld-syntax` for the broken JSON, and this
rule when the truncated text still holds a `<`. Other inline data blocks, such as
`application/json` and hydration state, carry the same risk and are out of scope.

There is no autofix. The fix rewrites `<` to `\u003c`, and every fix op subtracts; the
rewrite also belongs in the serializer.
