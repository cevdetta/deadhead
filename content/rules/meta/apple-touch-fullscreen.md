`<meta name="apple-touch-fullscreen">` asked the iPhone to open a page saved to the Home Screen without Safari's interface. Apple documented a different name for that job, `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, and the web app manifest now covers both.

## Why avoid

Apple's references leave it out. The Supported Meta Tags reference lists `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`, `format-detection` and `viewport`, and its guide to configuring web applications adds `apple-mobile-web-app-title`. `apple-touch-fullscreen` appears in neither. The WHATWG MetaExtensions registry holds it as a Proposal with "No specification yet" and the note "forces iPhone Fullscreen mode, if added to home screen. Not needed anymore."

The open engine sources do not read it either. WebKit's `HTMLMetaElement.cpp` acts on `viewport`, `theme-color`, `format-detection`, `apple-mobile-web-app-orientations` and `referrer`, among others, and not on this name. Chromium's web app metadata extraction reads `mobile-web-app-capable` and `apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, and not this name.

The HTML Standard's predefined metadata names do not include it, so the name rests on vendor practice alone.

## Use instead

Declare the launch mode in a web app manifest:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="/app.webmanifest">
```

```json
{
  "name": "Example",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone"
}
```

`meta/apple-mobile-web-app-capable` covers the documented Apple switch and what iOS still does with it.

## Detectability

Detectable with the selector alone. `<meta name>` holds a single value, so the rule matches with `=` and the `i` flag. The autofix deletes the element: Apple documents no reader for the name, and neither WebKit nor Chromium source reads it.
