A `robots` tag carrying a token outside the valid table asks for something no crawler honors. Google ignores the token, so a typo voids indexing intent with no warning.

## Why avoid

Google ignores what it does not list. An unknown token changes nothing, so `no-follow` follows links and `no-index` indexes the page.

The danger concentrates on exclusion typos. A mistyped `noindex` publishes what the author meant to hide, and nothing warns them.

Retired names trip too. `noarchive`, `nocache` and `nositelinkssearchbox` sit in Google's historical section as ignored, and `noodp`/`noydir` appear in neither table, so all five fail the same check.

## Use instead

Write valid directives, comma-separated:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">
```

## Detectability

Detectable with logic refining the selector. The selector prefilters to `robots` and `googlebot` tags; the module in `packages/rules/logic/meta/robots-directives.ts` folds `content` to lowercase and splits it on commas first. An item with a colon splits on its first colon into `name: value`; an item without one splits on whitespace into bare names. Each name is checked against the fourteen valid names, and parameterized names need a well-formed value. Google accepts RFC 822 and RFC 850 dates for `unavailable_after`, and those carry a comma of their own (`Sat, 25 Jun 2010 15:00:00 GMT`), so the items after an `unavailable_after` item fold back into its date until one opens with a valid name. Google documents comma-separated lists, so `noindex max-snippet:50` without the comma is reported: its first colon yields the name `noindex max-snippet`. The finding points at the tag.
