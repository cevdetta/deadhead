`<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style">` styles the status bar of a full-screen Home Screen app. No other browser acts on the switch. theme-color styles Safari's own tab and overscroll UI, a different surface, and does not replace it there.

## Why avoid

Apple defined the switch for full-screen Home Screen apps and marks it an Apple extension. It takes three values, `default`, `black`, and `black-translucent`. It has no effect without full-screen mode.

Deleting the sibling `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` tag does not remove that mode: since iOS 11.3 a manifest with `display` set to `standalone` launches the Home Screen app without it, and Maximiliano Firtman's iOS PWA compatibility table lists `black-translucent` as "still the only way to get a fullscreen app".

theme-color does not do this job. WebKit's Safari 15 announcement documents theme-color coloring "the status bar and overscroll area in Safari" itself, the browser chrome, not a standalone Home Screen app's status bar. Since Safari 26 even that Safari-chrome tint comes from the page background and fixed or sticky elements, not from theme-color (WebKit bug 301756). Apple's `black-translucent` value still lays page content under the status bar in a standalone app; only `content="default"`, the existing default, is a no-op.

## Use instead

Keep the tag if the site ships a full-screen Home Screen app and needs `black` or `black-translucent`. Ship theme-color too, for Safari's own UI, since it styles a different surface:

```html
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#226DAA">
```

Delete the tag only when its value is `default`, since that is already the default with the tag absent.

## Detectability

Detectable with one selector. Deadhead reports each `meta` with that name and skips pages without such an element. The match uses `=` with the `i` flag: `name` holds a single value, not a token set.

There is no autofix. A full-screen Home Screen app on current iOS loses `black`/`black-translucent` status-bar styling if the tag is deleted, since theme-color does not cover that surface; a person has to check the value and the app's display mode before removing the tag.

- [WebKit Bugzilla 301756](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=301756): as of Safari 26, Safari's own chrome tint comes from the page background and fixed or sticky elements, not from theme-color.
