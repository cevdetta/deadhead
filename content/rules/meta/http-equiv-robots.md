A `robots` or `X-Robots-Tag` in `http-equiv` reaches no crawler. `robots` is a metadata
*name* that ended up in the `http-equiv` attribute, and `X-Robots-Tag` names an HTTP response
header. The pragma table holds neither keyword, so both map to no state and browsers skip
them. Google documents two working syntaxes, `<meta name="robots">` in markup and
`X-Robots-Tag` in the header, and no third one.

## Why avoid

Directives in this form vanish without a trace. An author who wrote
`http-equiv="robots" content="noindex"` or `http-equiv="X-Robots-Tag" content="noindex"`
believes the page is excluded from results; the page stays indexed and its links stay
followed. The tag must move, not change shape: page-level indexing rules belong in
`<meta name="robots">`, the same rules for non-HTML resources in the `X-Robots-Tag` response
header, and crawling rules in `/robots.txt` at the service root.

The move has its own trap, which the replacement carries: robots.txt governs *crawling*, not
exclusion. Google's guidance is that robots.txt "is not a mechanism for keeping a web page
out of Google". To keep a page out, use noindex. A noindex works only if the page is not
blocked in robots.txt, because a blocked page is never fetched and its noindex never seen.
Disallow in robots.txt or noindex in the page, never both on the same URL.

## Use instead

For HTML pages, the meta name form:

```html
<meta name="robots" content="noindex">
```

For non-HTML resources such as PDFs or images, the response header:

```http
X-Robots-Tag: noindex
```

For crawling rules, robots.txt:

```http
User-Agent: *
Disallow: /private/
```

## Detectability

Complete detection: one element, two attribute values, matched with the `i` flag. There is
no autofix. Deleting either tag changes nothing a crawler does, since no crawler reads it,
but it deletes the only record of the author's noindex intent. Moving `robots` to the `name`
attribute is a rename, and an automated rename of an ignored indexing directive is the kind
of edit a human should confirm.

## Resources

- [Google Search Central: Robots meta tag, data-nosnippet, and X-Robots-Tag](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag): page-level settings go in `<meta name="robots">` on HTML pages or in the `X-Robots-Tag` HTTP response header; documents noindex semantics and the robots.txt interaction.
- [RFC 9309: Robots Exclusion Protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.txt): crawling rules "MUST be accessible in a file named /robots.txt (all lowercase) in the top-level path of the service."
- [HTML Standard: Pragma directives](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#pragma-directives): the closed pragma set has no entry for `robots` or `x-robots-tag`, so either `http-equiv` spelling maps to no state.
- [MDN: `<meta name="robots">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/robots): the in-document form is `<meta name="robots">`; Google, Yahoo, and Bing support the directives in the `X-Robots-Tag` HTTP header.
- [MDN: X-Robots-Tag header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Robots-Tag): typed as a response header; indexing rules live in that header or in a robots meta element.
