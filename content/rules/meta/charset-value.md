A `meta` charset value outside ASCII case-insensitive `utf-8` mislabels the document bytes. The browser trusts the label, so text decodes into mojibake.

## Why avoid

WHATWG demands an ASCII case-insensitive match for `utf-8`, and declares that the bytes have to be UTF-8 whether a declaration exists or not.

The Encoding Standard orders authors to use UTF-8 with the `utf-8` label, and documents masking attacks born of producer-consumer disagreement over encodings.

A wrong label breaks text for users first and security second. Mojibake is the visible failure; crafted bytes decoded under the wrong label are the quiet one.

## Use instead

Convert the bytes, then declare:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

Convert first with an editor or converter set to UTF-8 output. A label edit without the byte conversion corrupts every non-ASCII character on the page.

## Detectability

Detectable with the selector alone. `meta[charset]` prefilters to declarations, and `:not` with the `i` flag keeps the conforming `utf-8` spelling quiet while every other value trips the rule. An empty value matches nothing and trips it too. The check reads the label string alone: byte truth needs a converter, not a linter.

## Resources

- [WHATWG HTML: the meta element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-meta-element): the value has to be an ASCII case-insensitive match for `utf-8`, and the bytes have to be UTF-8 with or without a declaration.
- [Encoding Standard: names and labels](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels): authors have to use UTF-8 with the `utf-8` label, plus the security background on producer-consumer disagreement.
- [MDN: `<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta): UTF-8 is the single valid encoding for HTML5 documents.
