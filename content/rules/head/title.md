A document needs a single non-empty `title`. Zero titles, two titles and blank titles each trip this rule.

## Why avoid

The head model wants a title in most documents, and no document holds more than one. The count is a conformance rule, not guidance.

Without a title, the tab, the bookmark and the search-result heading go empty. Screen-reader users lose the page announcement they navigate by, which WCAG 2.4.2 demands as Level A.

A duplicate is non-conforming. Consumers honor one title and drop the rest unheard, so edits to the dropped ones change nothing.

A blank title passes the count and fails the purpose. An empty string names nothing, announces nothing, and ranks on nothing.

## Use instead

Write one descriptive title per page, purpose first:

```html
<title>How to deadhead roses - Garden Notes</title>
```

## Detectability

Countable in one document pass, which is why this is a `kind: "document"` rule: no selector can count to two. The logic in `packages/rules/logic/head/title.ts` lists the `title` elements once: no titles reports the `head`, each title past the first reports itself, and a `whitespace-only` title reports itself. The check reads text, never source offsets, so it reports in all three adapters.
