`language` on `script` still decides whether a script with no `type` attribute runs. WHATWG lists the attribute as obsolete with a split replacement, omission for JavaScript and `type` for data blocks, but the "prepare the script element" algorithm still reads it when `type` is absent, and a non-JavaScript value keeps the block from executing.

## Why avoid

WHATWG lists it as obsolete with a split replacement. Section 16.2 names `language` on `script` as obsolete: omit the attribute for JavaScript, and use `type` for data blocks. The "prepare the script element" algorithm still builds a type string from it when `type` is absent: "if el has a non-empty language attribute, let the script block's type string be the concatenation of `text/` and the value of el's language attribute." Chromium's `IsValidClassicScriptTypeAndLanguage` checks that string against the JavaScript MIME list. `language="vbscript"` produces `text/vbscript`, not a JavaScript MIME essence, so the block stays inert only while the attribute is there; deleting it with no `type` present defaults the type string to `text/javascript` and starts the block running.

MDN says the same from the attribute side. Its `script` page files `language` under deprecated attributes: it identifies the scripting language as `type` does; its values were never standardized, so `type` should be used instead. `language="javascript"` restates the default and changes nothing if deleted; a non-JavaScript value such as `language="vbscript"` is the only thing keeping that script block from running.

## Use instead

Omit the label for JavaScript:

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

Use `type` for data blocks:

```html
<script type="application/json" id="state">{ "user": null }</script>
```

## Detectability

Complete detection. The rule matches `script[language]`: presence of the attribute is the whole verdict. A logic module decides only whether the autofix runs. It deletes `language` where the script runs the same without it: the element has a `type` attribute, which overrides it; the value is empty; or `text/` plus the value is a JavaScript MIME type essence match, as with `javascript` or `JavaScript1.2`. Any other value with no `type` present, such as `vbscript`, keeps the block from running, and deleting it would start the block, the same bug class as `attr/script-event-for`. That finding carries no fix; a person has to delete the block or mark it with `type`.
