`type` on `style` selects nothing. WHATWG lists the attribute as obsolete with a split replacement, omission for CSS and `script` for data blocks, since CSS is the sole style language and the label restates the default.

## Why avoid

WHATWG lists it as obsolete with a split replacement. Section 16.1 says authors should not specify `type` on `style`: where the attribute is present its value must be an ASCII case-insensitive match for `text/css`. Section 16.2 names `type` on `style` as obsolete with the split direction: omit the attribute for CSS; for data blocks use `script` as the container in place of `style`. The label dates from an era when the style language was in question; with CSS as the sole style language the label restates the default.

MDN says the same from the element side. Its `style` page files `type` under deprecated attributes: you should not provide it, and where you do the sole permitted values are the empty string or a case-insensitive match for `text/css`. A `type="text/css"` that restates the default and a `type="TEXT/CSS"` in upper case both ask the browser for selection it never performs: the element applies CSS with or without the label.

## Use instead

Omit the label for CSS:

```html
<style>p { color: red; }</style>
```

Use `script` for data blocks:

```html
<script type="application/json" id="state">{ "user": null }</script>
```

## Detectability

Complete detection with a logic guard. `style[type]` is a pre-filter: the verdict depends on whether lowercased text equals `text/css`, a single-value match the selector subset cannot narrow. The decision lives in `packages/rules/logic/attr/style-type.ts`.

Anything the logic does not claim stays untouched, and two exclusions are load-bearing: a type with parameters, such as `text/css; charset=utf-8`, is not a match, so the browser reads that element as a data block and never applies it. Removing the attribute would start application of CSS that never applied. The same holds for a typo like `text/cs`. Both are real bugs; neither is safe to autofix, so this rule leaves them for a human look.
