`coords` and `shape` do nothing on anchors. WHATWG lists both as obsolete on `a` with one direction, use `area` for image maps, so the attributes are dead weight on every anchor that carries them.

## Why avoid

WHATWG lists both as obsolete with one replacement. Section 16.2 names `coords` on `a` elements and `shape` on `a` elements as obsolete, with a single direction: use `area` instead of `a` for image maps. The attributes sit in the non-conforming part of the page ("entirely obsolete, must not be used by authors"). An anchor carrying them links as it would without them; no shape is layered, no region becomes clickable.

The compat IDL changes nothing. Section 16.3.3 keeps reflecting `coords` and `shape` IDL members on anchors for old scripts. Reflection alone processes nothing: no image-map algorithm reads these attributes on anchors. Authors who copy them from old markup expect regions and get plain links.

## Use instead

A plain anchor where no map is meant:

```html
<a href="page.html">text</a>
```

An image map where one is meant, with the attributes on `area`:

```html
<img src="shapes.png" usemap="#shapes" alt="Four shapes">
<map name="shapes">
  <area shape="rect" coords="25,25,125,125" href="red.html" alt="Red box">
</map>
```

MDN documents the same shape with runnable map examples: `shape` selects the region kind and `coords` gives its geometry in CSS pixels.

## Detectability

Complete detection. The rule matches `a[coords]` or `a[shape]`: presence of either attribute is the whole verdict, so no logic module exists. The autofix removes every attribute the rule names that is present on the element, and leaves every other attribute as written.

## Resources

- [WHATWG: Non-conforming features](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/obsolete.html): `coords` and `shape` on `a` elements are obsolete with one direction: use `area` instead of `a` for image maps.
- [MDN: `<area>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/area): documents `coords`, `shape`, `href` and `alt` on `area` with runnable map examples.
- [WHATWG: The `area` element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/image-maps.html): `area` represents a hyperlink with a region on an image map, and `shape` plus `coords` specify the region.
