A `link rel=canonical` carrying `hreflang`, `lang`, `media` or `type` describes an alternate version of the page. Google does not use such annotations for canonicalization, so the consolidation signal stays silent.

## Why avoid

Google does not use canonical annotations carrying `hreflang`, `lang`, `media` or `type` for canonicalization. Such a tag suggests an alternate version, which contradicts the relation: a canonical names the preferred address of the same content.

The WHATWG link semantics agree from the other side. `hreflang` gives the language of the linked resource and `media` gives its applicable media, so the qualifiers describe a different version rather than the same content.

The signal then stays silent while the author believes it speaks. Duplicates never consolidate, and the preferred address gathers no ranking signals.

## Use instead

Keep the canonical plain, and declare alternates with a separate annotation:

```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/post">
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="fr" href="https://example.com/fr/post">
```

## Detectability

Detectable with the selector alone. `rel` matches with `~=` because it is a space-separated token set, and the comma lists one branch per qualifier. The autofix removes every attribute the rule names that is present on the element, and leaves every other attribute as written.

## Resources

- [Google Search Central: consolidate duplicate URLs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls): canonical annotations with `hreflang`, `lang`, `media` and `type` are not used for canonicalization; use the appropriate alternate annotations instead.
- [WHATWG HTML: the link element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-link-element): `hreflang` gives the language of the linked resource and `media` gives its applicable media.
- [Google Search Central: localized versions of your pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions): `link rel="alternate" hreflang` as the vehicle for language variants.
