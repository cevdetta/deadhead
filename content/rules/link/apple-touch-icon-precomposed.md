The `apple-touch-icon-precomposed` suffix is obsolete since iOS 7. Before iOS 7, Safari
dressed every home-screen icon in rounded corners and a glossy
highlight. Sites that had already drawn their own finish opted out with a second
spelling, `<link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed">`, and Apple's guidance was to
declare both. Favicon generators still write the pair, pointing both entries at the same PNG.

## Why avoid

The suffix no longer does anything. Apple's own guide says it plainly: "Safari on iOS 7
doesn't add effects to icons. Older versions of Safari will not add effects for icon
files named with the -precomposed.png suffix." Once no icon gets an effect, an opt-out
from that effect has nothing to opt out of. Google's Lighthouse documentation says the
same thing from the other side: the precomposed link "has been obsolete since iOS 7".

It isn't an unknown token. WebKit still parses `apple-touch-icon-precomposed` as a touch
icon type of its own, which is exactly why keeping it next to `apple-touch-icon` is a
problem rather than harmless noise. The page now declares its home-screen icon twice,
the two drift, and the next person to replace the icon has two places to change and no
way to tell from the markup which one a device will use.

## Use instead

One declaration, one 180×180 PNG:

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
```

Icons for an installable web app belong in the web app manifest as well; this link is
for iOS's home screen.

## Detectability

Fully detectable, but not with a selector: it's a document rule because it only fires
when a plain `apple-touch-icon` link also exists. A link whose `rel` carries both tokens
doesn't count as that plain link, since removing it would remove the page's only touch
icon. The rule does not report a lone precomposed link either. It is the page's only home-screen
icon, and no fix can rename a token.

The fix removes every precomposed link. Where the precomposed link points at the same
image as the plain one, or a smaller one, that changes nothing. There's one case it does
change: WebKit ranks touch icons by declared `sizes`, largest first, and prefers a
precomposed icon only when two are the same size. A precomposed link that is the
largest declared icon, or ties in size with a different image, is the one WebKit picks,
and after the fix the plain link's image is used instead. Check the sizes before applying
the fix to a page that declares more than one icon.
